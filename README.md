This is an attempt at a bottom up approach to eventually gets to democratization of database SME knowledge, and hopefully semantic querying of databases. At the end of the day, giving people the ability to go into a fucked sideways SAP or other transactional system to ask questions without having to go to an analyst, data architect, solution architect, or other professional. Cutting out the middleman, and make people/companies data usable.
